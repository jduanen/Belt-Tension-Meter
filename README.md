Belt Tension Meter

A tool for measuring G2 belt tension for Shapoko-/X-Carve-like CNC machines.
Uses the load cell from a luggage hand scale \[1\] and a 3D-printed part \[2\] to create a small device that is placed under a belt, at its mid-point and displays the amount of tension on the belt in pounds or grams.

The Inventables Forum ![Inventables Forum](https://discuss.inventables.com/) has advice for how to measure and set the tension on drive belts for the X-Carve.  A common suggestion involves pulling a belt up to one inch hieght at its mid-point with a hand-held scale and tensioning the belt to between three and six pounds.

By varying the length of the pan-head M4 bolt attached to the load cell, it is possible
